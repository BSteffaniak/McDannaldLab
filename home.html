            <p>Events in our environment exist on a continuum of certain safety to extreme danger. Rather than leaving encounters with safety and danger to chance, people and animals attend to their environment in order to predict the occurrence of safety and danger. This ability to predict permits us to recognize and avoid danger before it happens, but also to recognize and seek safety. Research in the McDannald lab aims to uncover the neural basis of prediction. In particular, we are interested in mapping neural circuits permitting accurate and rapid prediction of danger versus safety, as well as more graded predictions in situations of uncertainty. We are further interested in how adverse early life experiences, such as stress or heavy alcohol drinking, disrupt predictive capacities in adulthood and perhaps for the lifetime. The goal of our research is to map the neural circuits for prediction, and leverage this information to uncover neural sources of dysfunction in individuals with adverse life histories. To achieve this, we employ behavioral procedures inspired by, or directly from, the learning theory tradition in combination with specific early life experiences, single-unit recording, and precise optogenetic manipulation of neural activity.</p>
