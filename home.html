    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Research in the McDannald lab aims to uncover the neural basis of prediction. In particular, we are interested in mapping neural circuits permitting accurate and rapid prediction of danger or safety, as well as more graded predictions of threat in situations of uncertainty. We are further interested in how adverse early life experiences, such as stress or heavy alcohol drinking, disrupt predictive capacities in adulthood and perhaps for the lifetime. The goal of our research is to map the neural circuits for prediction, and leverage this information to uncover neural sources of dysfunction in individuals experiencing early life adversity. To achieve this, we employ behavioral procedures inspired by, or directly from, the learning theory tradition in combination with specific early life experiences, single-unit recording, and precise optogenetic manipulation of neural activity.</p>
