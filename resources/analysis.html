        All behavioral data are analyzed with Matlab. The script provided here calculates a suppression 

        ratio for each trial, for each cue, for each rat. This is done by first calculating nose poke rates 

        from two periods: the 20-s baseline period just prior to cue onset, and the 10-s cue period. A 

        suppression ratio is calculated for the cue as follows: ((baseline nose poke rate – cue nose poke 

        rate) / (baseline nose poke rate + cue nose poke rate)). A value of ‘1’ indicates complete 

        suppression of nose poking during the cue window, relative to baseline, and high fear. A value 

        of ‘0’ indicates no suppression, and no fear. Gradations between ‘0’ and ‘1’ permit intermediate 

        levels of cued fear to be measured.

        This script groups individuals into ‘Control’ or ‘Lesion’ based on the ID of the subject, which is 

        manually entered by the experimenter. Further groups can be added by creating new variables 

        with unique names and assigning individuals to that variable. Means and standard error of 

        means are then calculated for each cue, for each trial (Tbt), each individual (Ind) and the whole 

        group (G).

        The final output of the script is three graphs: individual baseline nose poke rates, individual 

        suppression ratios to each cue (averaged over whole session) and group suppression ratios to 

        each cue (averaged over session), for the session analyzed. Output looks like that below.
