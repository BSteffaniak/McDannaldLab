        In order to overcome the limited variety of auditory cues offered by the Med Associates system, 

        Benjamin Berg (of Berg et al 2014) developed an Arduino-based device – the Ardbark – that 

        stores custom-made .wav files on a SD card, interfaces with the Med System and plays the 

        .wav files through ceiling mounted speakers. Instructions on assembly and programming of the 

        Ardbark are provided here:

        The script controlling the Ardbark is written with standard software for the Arduino Uno. This 

        software is free for download. The folder below contains the script as well as necessary support 

        files and the necessary file order of the SD card.

        Standard discrimination procedures in our laboratory use the following three auditory cues. 

        Each is 10 seconds long and consists of a repeating motif. We have found these cues to be 

        equally salient yet highly discriminable.
