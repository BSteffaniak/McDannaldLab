        Our lab uses Med Associates hardware/software. Functioning of the programs provided here

        depend on a specific configuration of the Med Associates Smart Control Panel (our lab uses 

        SG-716B). Standard configuration for our lab:

        Prior to each behavior session, all inputs and outputs are tested with a single program in which

        a single nose poke delivers a food pellet then tests in serial: auditory, visual and foot shock 

        stimuli. Content of .pdf file can be copied and pasted into Med Trans IV and saved as an .mpc 

        file.

        In most experiments, subjects first learn to nose poke for a food reward. Rewarded nose poking

        is maintained throughout behavioral testing. Independent of nose poking, auditory cues are 

        played that predict shock with different probabilities, for example: 1.00, 0.25 or 0.00. The 

        assignment of physical cue identity to shock probability is counterbalanced between individuals 

        in a group by using different Med Associates programs. Here is an example of a Med 

        Associates program used for discrimination.

        In order for our analysis programs to function, behavioral sessions must be named in a

        particular way, shown here. This is because Matlab uses the ordered information in this string 

        for analysis.

        Data from Med Associates programs are saved into a single file for each calendar day. From

        this single file, individual sessions are split out using a Matlab script. All analyses are performed 

        on the individual session data.
