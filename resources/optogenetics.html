        Our laboratory uses standard optogenetic constructs primarily obtained from the University of 

        North Carolina Vector Core. In the process of combining optogenetic inhibition/excitation with 

        behavior, a number of problems presented themselves, requiring custom solutions. By far the 

        biggest problem was destruction of the optogenetic cable (Thor, Multimode FC/PC Fiber Optic 

        Patch Cables with Ferrule Ends). Specifically, the ferrule end of this cable is very weak, and 

        would break shortly into a behavior session. To overcome this problem we construct 

        optogenetic cables with flexible metal shielding as follows:

        We have also modified this protocol to make a bilateral, optogenetic cable:

    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we make, polish and calibrate all ferrule implants. This is a relatively common 

        practice. Our protocol is here:

    </p>
    <p>
        Use of these protocols has greatly lengthened the 

        life of our optogenetic cables and has permitted the 

        cable to be plugged in for the entirety of behavioral 

        sessions, which can last upwards of 90 minutes. 

        However, even after implementing this cable 

        design, we would occasionally have rats come 

        unplugged during a behavior session. We 

        discovered this was largely due to the relatively 

        small opening atop the Med Associates chamber. 

        To overcome this problem we modified the tops of 

        each chamber by enlarging the hole (to ~4 inches 

        in diameter) and epoxying a funnel on top. The 

        funnel tapers down to ~1.5 inches and is centered 

        exactly below the ceiling-mounted commutator. 

        This design permits the cable to move freely with 

        little or no contact with the behavioral chamber.
